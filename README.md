# Model Evaluation Report

## **Confusion Matrix Analysis**

### **Bird (True):**
- **Correct predictions:** 69
- **Misclassified as "Cat":** 8
- **Misclassified as "Dog":** 23

### **Cat (True):**
- **Correct predictions:** 35
- **Misclassified as "Bird":** 27
- **Misclassified as "Dog":** 38

### **Dog (True):**
- **Correct predictions:** 62
- **Misclassified as "Bird":** 12
- **Misclassified as "Cat":** 26

---

## **Interpretation**
1. The model has a strong bias towards **"Bird"** and **"Dog"**, frequently misclassifying **"Cat"** as one of these two.
2. Misclassifications between **"Cat"** and **"Dog"** are particularly high, indicating poor feature differentiation for these classes.
3. The model achieves **55% accuracy** for a 3-class classification problem.
   - Random guessing for 3 classes would give an accuracy of ~33%, so the model is only marginally better than random.

## **Recommendations for Improvement**

### **1. Data Augmentation**
- Apply more aggressive data augmentation techniques for underperforming classes (e.g., **"Cat"**) to improve the model's robustness.

### **2. Class Balancing**
- Ensure balanced training samples for all classes.
- Alternatively, introduce **class weights** during training to mitigate the impact of class imbalance.

### **3. Feature Engineering**
- Visualize and analyze the feature representations learned by the model to understand why **"Cat"** is frequently misclassified.
- Consider adding or enhancing **class-specific features** to improve differentiation between classes.

### **4. Fine-Tuning**
- Unfreeze more layers of the pre-trained model (e.g., the top convolutional layers) to allow better feature learning for the challenging classes.

By implementing these improvements, the model's performance is likely to improve significantly, particularly in distinguishing between **"Cat"** and other classes.
